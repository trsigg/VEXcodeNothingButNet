This is the code repository for the VEX competition
Each Robot has a master file, in which I will put all functions already on it or ready for it on.
There will be other functions and tasks available to Robots on this website.
To attach the tasks, copy/paste the void, int, and float variables into the variable area, copy/paste any additional motor/sensor setup, then copy paste the task before tast main. In task main, Find the control you want, and put startTask (Task Name) into the if loop.
Control will be added shortly.
